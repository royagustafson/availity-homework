## Answers
1. At FairWarning, I created the backbone service that allowed us to start breaking up our monolithic architecture. I put a lot of time and care into this project, research on best practices, 90% automated test coverage, and an automated testing suite in Postman that sent requests to a custom built development environment. I was very nervous about creating a login server, and I think that nervousness prompted me to triple check everything, exactly what is required in cybersecurity. 
2. Not sure yet
3. Availity cuts down the amount of time and effort required when switching doctors, following referrals, or getting prescriptions, by giving medical offices a common language to talk to each other and share important information.
4. See "LispParenthesesHelper.java" and "LispParenthesesHelperTest.java." Code is fully functional and all tests pass. 
5. See "RegistrationForm.tsx". Start the React server by running "npm start" under the "client" directory. Form is fully functional (front-end only). 
6. See "EnrolleeReaderService.java." This code is NOT functional, but demonstrates how I'd go about this project with a simple CSV libraries.
