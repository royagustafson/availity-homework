## Answers
1. At FairWarning, I created the backbone service that allowed us to start breaking up our monolithic architecture. I put a lot of time and care into this project, research on best practices, 90% automated test coverage, and an automated testing suite in Postman that sent requests to a custom built development environment. I was very nervous about creating a login server, and I think that nervousness prompted me to triple check everything, exactly what is required in cybersecurity. 
2. For a literal read, I've been reading through Gann's "Truth of the Stock Tape" (1923). It's an older read, but I enjoy Gann's philosophy in cutting out the noise and hype of stock trading and focusing on the metrics that matter. I think with the prevalence of misinformation in today's day and age, the ability to tune signal out of noise is an even more invaluable skill, and I feel this book has taught me that in a bigger way than simply trading stocks. I've also recently watched Coded Bias on Netflix, which is about the tendency for AI systems to extrapolate the bias that exists in the datasets they learn from. While not a book, article, or repo, I think it's relevant to this question. If you do give it a watch, be patient - the target market is not IT workers. Still, I believe it's important to keep the mysticism surrounding machine learning in check by testing how it truly is working in practice. The lack of visibibility we currently have into these black box systems can only hurt us in the long run. 
4. Availity cuts down the amount of time and effort required when switching doctors, following referrals, or getting prescriptions, by giving medical offices a common language to talk to each other and share important information.
5. See "LispParenthesesHelper.java" and "LispParenthesesHelperTest.java." Code is fully functional and all tests pass. 
6. See "RegistrationForm.tsx". Start the React server by running "npm start" under the "client" directory. Form is fully functional (front-end only). 
7. See "EnrolleeReaderService.java." This code is NOT functional, but demonstrates how I'd go about this project with a simple CSV libraries.
